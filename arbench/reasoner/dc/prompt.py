Question to Dr. Samuel Reed: Did you have any disagreements with Dr. Amelia Harper recently? Feedback: While there was some underlying tension between us regarding the credit for our research, our discussion at Riverside Park was intense but professional, and we didn't have any overt disagreements that would suggest a motive for such a heinous act.

Question to Professor Henry Collins: Did you notice anything unusual about Ethan Turner's behavior at the park? Feedback: He seemed nervous and agitated, but I was too preoccupied with my own thoughts after the argument with Amelia to pay much attention to him at the time.
Question to Dr. Laura Bennett: Did you see anyone else at the park after your meeting with Dr. Harper? Feedback: I noticed Ethan Turner near the crime scene, nervously pacing, at around 3:15 PM, but I was too absorbed in my own turmoil to give it much thought at the time.

Question to Alice Parker: Did you have any professional conflicts or disagreements with Dr. Harper in the past? Feedback: Dr. Harper and I did have a rather heated debate at a conference a few months ago regarding a research paper, but I wouldn't call it a conflict, although I did notice she seemed a bit... uneasy after our discussion, which now that I think about it, is quite interesting given the circumstances.
Question to Professor Henry Collins: Did you have any professional disagreements with Dr. Harper recently? Feedback: We had a long-standing rivalry, and our meeting at the park was actually about a recent discovery I had made, which she unfortunately dismissed as inconsequential compared to her own work.

Question to Ethan Turner: Did you see Professor Henry Collins leave an artifact with Dr. Harper during your time at the park? Feedback: I don't think so, but I did see Professor Collins and Dr. Bennett arguing, and then Dr. Bennett walked away, and, uh, I noticed a bird building a nest in a nearby tree, it was fascinating to watch, and, oh, I just remembered that I need to return a book to the library, it's overdue.

Reason: 
1. Dr. Amelia Harper was killed with a heavy, ancient artifact, which suggests someone who had access to or handled such artifacts.

General Instruction for Solving a Murder Case:
1. Review the Case Details: Gather all known information about the victim, location, time, and any evidence collected.
2. Identify Key Suspects: List individuals with potential motives, access to the crime scene, or connections to the victim.
3. Analyze Evidence: Examine physical evidence, forensic reports, and witness statements for inconsistencies or connections.
4. Establish Timelines: Map out a detailed timeline of events for the victim and each suspect around the time of the murder.
5. Identify Motives: Investigate personal, financial, or emotional factors that may drive each suspect to commit the crime.
6. Determine Means and Opportunity: Evaluate each suspect's ability to commit the crime and whether they had access to the murder weapon or crime scene.
7. Plan Interrogations: Develop targeted questions to probe suspects' alibis, relationships with the victim, and knowledge of the crime.
8. Detect Lies and Gaps: Pay close attention to inconsistencies, evasive answers, or emotional responses during interrogations.
9. Correlate Evidence with Testimonies: Cross-check suspects' statements against physical evidence and other witnesses' accounts.
10. Eliminate Suspects: Rule out individuals who have solid alibis, lack motives, or are otherwise proven innocent.
11. Formulate a Theory: Synthesize all findings to build a logical narrative of how the murder occurred and who is most likely responsible.
12. Present the Case: Ensure the conclusion is supported by clear evidence, consistent reasoning, and a definitive connection to the suspect.
13. Validate the Outcome: Reassess the reasoning and evidence to confirm the solution is accurate and free from bias or oversight.
